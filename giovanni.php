					<h2> Where I'm From... </h2>
					<p>I was born in Sicily in the city of Messina but I moved to Milan when I was 3 years old. After
						studying
						Information Technology
						and Science at high school, I decided I wanted to attend University abroad. Originally I
						intended to
						study in the US
						but I then decided to apply to universities in the UK, because studying in America was extremely
						expensive. At 19 I therefore
						moved to England to study Computer Science at the University of York. I studied 2 years at York
						and
						although the campus
						and the courses were great I still had the dream to study in the US! So I applied to the
						exchange
						program for North America
						and I managed to be selected for the University of Rochester.

				<h2>My Time in America...</h2>
				<p>I am currently spending my year abroad at Rochester and I have to say that so far it has been one of
					the
					greatest experiences
					of my life. Since the moment I arrived here I felt like it was the right place for me, from the
					people I
					met to the very
					stimulating environment that this campus offers. Besides focusing on my academics I also decided to
					get
					involved in extra
					curricular activities, so I ended up creating a fitness club called Meliora Fitness to promote the
					benefits of physical
					exercise and provide free bodyweight training classes to students. Additionally I also took part in
					Greek Life by joining
					Beta Theta Pi, a fraternity in which I was able to find many smart and like minded people.
				</p>
				<p>In my Fall semester I took 5 classes: CAS 170 which is a class for international students regarding
					the
					American culture,
					CSC 240 Data Mining which was quite interesting but I realized that it is not an area I want to
					expand
					on, CSC 214 iOS
					Development where I learned and experimented with Swift, CSC 170 Intro to Web Development which
					allowed
					to learn web
					development in a formal way and also made me practice my design skills, finally CSC 210 which
					focused
					more on Back End
					technologies and was a great complement to CSC 170. I am enjoying my experience at Rochester so much
					that I am considering
					transferring and finishing my degree there. Although the transfer process is quite complex for my
					situation, since I
					am a third year student, I believe it will be worth graduating in the US. Especially considering my
					goal
					to eventually
					move to California and create a business there.
