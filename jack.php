					<h2> Background </h2>
					<p>I am originally from Louisiana, but I moved around the state a lot. At the beginning of sophomore
						year of high school,
						I left my home to attend a public, boarding school in rural, northern Louisiana. My high school
						was very different from
						others in that its focus was academics and maintaining a positive public image (it was basically
						UofR). Therefore, while
						I volunteered a lot and did various other community service events, I was learning a lot about
						what I wanted to do. It
						was there, where I learned about careers in the sciences and began to think about what I wanted
						to do with my life. Three
						years later, I was faced with the decision to stay or leave Louisiana. In the end, I decided
						that there werenâ€™t many
						opportunities for me in Louisiana, and I eventually learned of the UofR. This campus offered me
						a different perspective
						on cultural, social, and political issues, which trully interested me. And here I am.

				<h2>Extra Curriculars</h2>
				<p>During my time at the University of Rochester, I have worked at a couple of different positions.
					During
					the summers, I
					worked at Lullaby Sound Design in Louisiana, which is a company that makes hand-made, tube
					amplifiers
					for guitars and
					violins. There I learned how to make these amplifiers and the different devices that were sold.
					During
					the academic years,
					I have also worked on campus as a CHM 132 Lab TA, which gave me a new perspective on the
					experiments,
					and I am currently
					a CSC 240/440 TA. Additionally, I am in the process of being hired for a student-worker position on
					campus, which I am
					excited for.

				<h2>Academic Information</h2>
				<p>I am a Mechanical Engineering major at the University of Rochester, and I am also minoring in
					Computer
					Science. I am very
					interested in how the world works, and I find both theoretical research and its application
					interesting.
					However, I decided
					to major in Mechanical Engineering because the idea of building something that could impact others
					interests me, which
					is why I also decided to minor in computer science. So far at UofR, I have taken the following
					courses:
					CSC 170, CSC
					171, CSC 172, CSC 214, and CSC 240. Additionally, I have been a CHM 132 Lab Teacher Assistant, and I
					am
					currently a CSC
					240/440 TA.
