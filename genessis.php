					<h2> Background </h2>
					<p>I am a native to Los Angeles, California. I do not really know why I thought coming to school in
						New York would be a good
						idea but it somehow ended up happening because I think I thought I could handle the snow. I am
						now fed up with the snow
						but I do love the University of Rochester and do believe that I ended up where I was meant to. I
						originally came to UR,
						I planned to double major in Business and Computer Science and minor in Political Science but
						after taking a few classes
						and finding out what I really enjoyed, I decided to major in Business and move Computer Science
						to a minor and pick up
						a Spanish minor.

				<h2>Extra Curriculars</h2>
				<p>Upon arriving to UR, I also got involved in extracurricular activities. My freshman year, I got
					involved
					with Students’
					Association (SA) and served on the Administration & Review Committee (ARC) as a Student Analyst,
					rushed
					Alpha Kappa Psi
					(AKPsi) (a business professional co-ed fraternity) and became Vice President of Alumni Relations, a
					general member on
					the Student Programming Board, and a general member of Gamma Phi Beta (GPB) (a social sorority).
					Moving
					into my sophomore
					year, I was elected to the 2020 Class Council and served as a Programming Chair, continued to serve
					as
					Vice President
					of Alumni Relations for AKPsi, was appointed Deputy Chair of ARC, served as Corresponding Secretary
					for
					GPB, and I also
					was a D’Lion. I am currently in my junior year where I am now Vice President of 2020 Class Council,
					dual
					as Chairwoman
					of Collegiate & Alumni Relations and Chairwoman of Community Service for GPB, continue to serve as a
					Student Analyst
					for ARC, a second year D’Lion, and Social Chair for Alpha Kappa Psi. I plan to remain actively
					involved
					in all of my
					extracurricular activities throughout the remainder of my college experience as I have learned many
					important and valuable
					experiences through them.
